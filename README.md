# Hound-Bot
###### created by: Daniel Milholland (@Milhound)

This bot was created using the discord.js library, for the discordapp api. All of Hound-Bot's code excluding the node_modules were written by me (Daniel Milholland).

If attempting to use this bot on your own server, please note you will have to remove the node_modules folder and perform the following commands:
```terminal
npm cache clear
npm install --save discord.js
npm install --save ytdl-core
```
